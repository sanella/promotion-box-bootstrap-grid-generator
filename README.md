# promotion-box-bootstrap-grid-generator
I made this app to help me generate the code for promotion boxes. 

Live Demo: http://quiet-springs-35701.herokuapp.com/

You need to choose 2 or 3 bootstrap colons.  
If you chose 2, fill in the first and the second box, if you chose 3 colons you need to fill in the  first, second and third box.
For each colon you can chose 3 options (full image - just one image in that colon, Option 2 - Two pictures in colon, and 
Option 3 - Three pictures in colon)
In the text fields 'Image link' you need to add image links (i.e. http://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/suicide-squad-harley-quinn-margot-robbie.jpg)
If you do not fill this field the app will use placeholder image as the default image.
In text fields 'Image description:' you can add the image description. The description will be visible on the hover image. This is not a mandatory field.

I hope this will be useful for someone :)
